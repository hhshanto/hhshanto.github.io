# About Me

Hello! I'm Hasan, currently based in the beautiful city of Potsdam, Germany. I'm a curious soul with a passion for learning and understanding the world around us through different lenses - be it science, philosophy, or culture.

## My Journey

Originally from Bangladesh, my journey has taken me from the bustling streets of Dhaka to the historic landscapes of Brandenburg. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Potsdam, where I get to combine my love for technology with practical problem-solving.

## What I Do

During the day, I work as a Research Data Scientist at KPMG Global Solution Group, where I help build intelligent systems that make complex information more accessible and useful. I'm also a Research Assistant at the University of Potsdam, contributing to meaningful research on migration patterns.

## Beyond Work

While my professional life revolves around data and technology, my interests span far beyond. I'm deeply fascinated by:

- **Physics and Natural Sciences**: Understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe
- **Philosophy**: Exploring different ways of thinking and understanding life
- **Literature**: Discovering new perspectives through books
- **Cultural Exchange**: Learning from different cultures and viewpoints

## Why This Space?

This digital garden is my attempt to document and share my journey through various fields of knowledge. Here, you'll find my thoughts, learnings, and explorations across different subjects - from scientific concepts to philosophical musings.
